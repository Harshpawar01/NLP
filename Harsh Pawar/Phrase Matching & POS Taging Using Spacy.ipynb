OWL CREEK BRIDGE\\n\\nby Ambrose Bierce\\n\\nI\\n\\nA man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down\\ninto the swift water twenty feet below.',\n"," \"The man's hands were behind\\nhis back, the wrists bound with a cord.\",\n"," 'A rope closely encircled his\\nneck.',\n"," 'It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the\\nslack fell to the level of his knees.',\n"," 'Some loose boards laid upon the\\nties supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him\\nand his executioners--two private soldiers of the Federal army,\\ndirected by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy\\nsheriff.',\n"," 'At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an\\nofficer in the uniform of his rank, armed.',\n"," 'He was a captain.',\n"," 'A\\nsentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the\\nposition known as \"support,\" that is to say, vertical in front of the\\nleft shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight\\nacross the chest--a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect\\ncarriage of the body.',\n"," 'It did not appear to be the duty of these two\\nmen to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they\\nmerely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it.',\n"," 'Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran\\nstraight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was\\nlost to view.',\n"," 'Doubtless there was an outpost farther along.',\n"," 'The\\nother bank of the stream was open ground--a gentle slope topped with\\na stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a\\nsingle embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon\\ncommanding the bridge.',\n"," 'Midway up the slope between the bridge and\\nfort were the spectators--a single company of infantry in line, at\\n\"parade rest,\" the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels\\ninclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands\\ncrossed upon the stock.',\n"," 'A lieutenant stood at the right of the line,\\nthe point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his\\nright.',\n"," 'Excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a\\nman moved.',\n"," 'The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless.',\n"," 'The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues\\nto adorn the bridge.',\n"," 'The captain stood with folded arms, silent,\\nobserving the work of his subordinates, but making no sign.',\n"," 'Death is a\\ndignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal\\nmanifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him.',\n"," 'In\\nthe code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of\\ndeference.',\n"," 'The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about\\nthirty-five years of age.',\n"," 'He was a civilian, if one might judge from\\nhis habit, which was that of a planter.',\n"," 'His features were good--a\\nstraight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark\\nhair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar\\nof his well fitting frock coat.',\n"," 'He wore a moustache and pointed\\nbeard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a\\nkindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose\\nneck was in the hemp.',\n"," 'Evidently this was no vulgar assassin.',\n"," 'The\\nliberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of\\npersons, and gentlemen are not excluded.',\n"," 'The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped\\naside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing.',\n"," 'The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself\\nimmediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace.',\n"," 'These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on\\nthe two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties\\nof the bridge.',\n"," 'The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not\\nquite, reached a fourth.',\n"," 'This plank had been held in place by the\\nweight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant.',\n"," 'At a\\nsignal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would\\ntilt and the condemned man go down between two ties.',\n"," 'The arrangement\\ncommended itself to his judgement as simple and effective.',\n"," 'His face\\nhad not been covered nor his eyes bandaged.',\n"," 'He looked a moment at his\\n\"unsteadfast footing,\" then let his gaze wander to the swirling water\\nof the stream racing madly beneath his feet.',\n"," 'A piece of dancing\\ndriftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the\\ncurrent.',\n"," 'How slowly it appeared to move!',\n"," 'What a sluggish stream!',\n"," 'He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and\\nchildren.',\n"," 'The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding\\nmists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the\\nsoldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him.',\n"," 'And now he\\nbecame conscious of a new disturbance.',\n"," \"Striking through the thought\\nof his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor\\nunderstand, a sharp,

sharpness.',\n"," 'They hurt\\nhis ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared he would shriek.',\n"," 'What he\\nheard was the ticking of his watch.',\n"," 'He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him.',\n"," '\"If I could\\nfree my hands,\" he thought, \"I might throw off the noose and spring\\ninto the stream.',\n"," 'By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming\\nvigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home.',\n"," 'My\\nhome, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little\\nones are still beyond the invader\\'s farthest advance.\"',\n"," \"As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were\\nflashed into the doomed man's brain rather than evolved from it the\\ncaptain nodded to the sergeant.\",\n"," 'The sergeant stepped aside.',\n"," 'II\\n\\nPeyton Farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly\\nrespected Alabama family.',\n"," 'Being a slave owner and like other slave\\nowners a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and\\nardently devoted to the Southern cause.',\n"," 'Circumstances of an imperious\\nnature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from\\ntaking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous\\ncampaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the\\ninglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the\\nlarger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction.',\n"," 'That\\nopportunity, he felt, would come, as it comes to all in wartime.',\n"," 'Meanwhile he did what he could.',\n"," 'No service was too humble for him to\\nperform in the aid of the South, no adventure too perilous for him to\\nundertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at\\nheart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much\\nqualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous\\ndictum that all is fair in love and war.',\n"," 'One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench\\nnear the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the\\ngate and asked for a drink of water.',\n"," 'Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy\\nto serve him with her own white hands.',\n"," 'While she was fetching the\\nwater her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly\\nfor news from the front.',\n"," '\"The Yanks are repairing the railroads,\" said the man, \"and are\\ngetting ready for another advance.',\n"," 'They have reached the Owl Creek\\nbridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank.',\n"," 'The\\ncommandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring\\nthat any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges,\\ntunnels, or trains will be summarily hanged.',\n"," 'I saw the order.\"',\n"," '\"How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?\"',\n"," 'Farquhar asked.',\n"," '\"About thirty miles.\"',\n"," '\"Is there no force on this side of the creek?\"',\n"," '\"Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single\\nsentinel at this end of the bridge.\"',\n"," '\"Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the\\npicket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,\" said\\nFarquhar, smiling, \"what could he accomplish?\"',\n"," 'The soldier reflected.',\n"," '\"I was there a month ago,\" he replied.',\n"," '\"I\\nobserved that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of\\ndriftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge.',\n"," 'It is\\nnow dry and would burn like tinder.\"',\n"," 'The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank.',\n"," 'He\\nthanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.',\n"," 'An\\nhour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going\\nnorthward in the direction from which he had come.',\n"," 'He was a Federal\\nscout.',\n"," 'III\\n\\nAs Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost\\nconsciousness and was as one already dead.',\n"," 'From this state he was\\nawakened--ages later, it seemed to him--by the pain of a sharp\\npressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation.',\n"," 'Keen,\\npoignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every\\nfiber of his body and limbs.',\n"," 'These pains appeared to flash along well\\ndefined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid\\nperiodicity.',\n"," 'They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him\\nto an intolerable temperature.',\n"," 'As to his head, he was conscious of\\nnothing but a feeling of fullness--of congestion.',\n"," 'These sensations\\nwere unaccompanied by thought.',\n"," 'The intellectual part of his nature\\nwas already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was\\ntorment.',\n"," 'He was conscious of motion.',\n"," 'Encompassed in a luminous cloud,\\nof which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material\\nsubstance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a\\nvast pendulum.',\n"," 'Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light\\nabout him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful\\nroaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark.',\n"," 'The power of\\nthought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had\\nfallen into the stream.',\n"," 'There was no additional strangulation; the\\nnoose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water\\nfrom his lungs.',\n"," 'To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea\\nseemed to him ludicrous.',\n"," 'He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw\\nabove him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible!',\n"," 'He was\\nstill sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a\\nmere glimmer.',\n"," 'Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he\\nwas rising toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he was now\\nvery comfortable.',\n"," '\"To be hanged and drowned,\" he thought, \"that is\\nnot so bad; but I do not wish to be shot.',\n"," 'No; I will not be shot;\\nthat is not fair.\"',\n"," 'He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist\\napprised him that he was trying to free his hands.',\n"," 'He gave the\\nstruggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a\\njuggler, without interest in the outcome.',\n"," 'What splendid effort!--what\\nmagnificent, what superhuman strength!',\n"," 'Ah, that was a fine endeavor!',\n"," 'Bravo!',\n"," 'The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the\\nhands dimly seen on each side in the growing light.',\n"," 'He watched them\\nwith a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the\\nnoose at his neck.',\n"," 'They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside,\\nits undulations resembling those of a water snake.',\n"," '\"Put it back, put\\nit back!\"',\n"," 'He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the\\nundoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had\\nyet experienced.',\n"," 'His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire, his\\nheart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to\\nforce itself out at his mouth.',\n"," 'His whole body was racked and wrenched\\nwith an insupportable anguish!',\n"," 'But his disobedient hands gave no heed\\nto the command.',\n"," 'They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward\\nstrokes, forcing him to the surface.',\n"," 'He felt his head emerge; his\\neyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively,\\nand with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great\\ndraught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!',\n"," 'He was now in full possession of his physical senses.',\n"," 'They were,\\nindeed, preternaturally keen and alert.',\n"," 'Something in the awful\\ndisturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that\\nthey made record of things never before perceived.',\n"," 'He felt the\\nripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck.',\n"," 'He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual\\ntrees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf--he saw the very\\ninsects upon them:  the locusts, the brilliant bodied flies, the gray\\nspiders stretching their webs from twig to twig.',\n"," 'He noted the\\nprismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass.',\n"," \"The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream,\\nthe beating of the dragon flies' wings, the strokes of the water\\nspiders' legs, like oars which had lifted their boat--all these made\\naudible music.\",\n"," 'A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the\\nrush of its body parting the water.',\n"," 'He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the\\nvisible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point,\\nand he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the\\ncaptain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners.',\n"," 'They were\\nin silhouette against the blue sky.',\n"," 'They shouted and gesticulated,\\npointing at him.',\n"," 'The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire;\\nthe others were unarmed.',\n"," 'Their movements were grotesque and horrible,\\ntheir forms gigantic.',\n"," 'Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water\\nsmartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with\\nspray.',\n"," 'He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with\\nhis rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the\\nmuzzle.',\n"," 'The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge\\ngazing into his own through the sights of the rifle.',\n"," 'He observed that\\nit was a gray eye and remembered having read that gray eyes were\\nkeenest, and that all famous marksmen had them.',\n"," 'Nevertheless, this one\\nhad missed.',\n"," 'A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was\\nagain looking at the forest on the bank opposite the fort.',\n"," 'The sound\\nof a clear, high

at will.',\n"," 'God help me,\\nI cannot dodge them all!\"',\n"," 'An appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud,\\nrushing sound, DIMINUENDO, which seemed to travel back through the air\\nto the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to\\nits deeps!',\n"," 'A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon\\nhim, blinded him, strangled him!',\n","
